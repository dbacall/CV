## David Bacall

I am an ambitious junior full stack developer. I recently left a role in tax technology consulting 
hoping to find a career that will satisfy my need for creativity and problem solving.
Having begun to learn to code and really found enjoyment in it I was lucky enough to
hear about Makers Academy.

I started the course at Makers in October and have learnt many of the cornerstones of what it
is to be a good coder. With a heavy focus on test driven development, debugging and not just how
to use one language, but gaining an understanding of what it is that defines a programming language. I now 
feel confident that I can pick up any programming language in a short space of time and have the 
necessary skills to add value to your team of developers.
