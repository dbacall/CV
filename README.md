## David Bacall

I am an ambitious junior developer, looking for a role where I can apply my current
programming knowledge and also develop further as a software engineer.

Having graduated the University of Birmingham with a Maths degree, I spent two years
travelling around India, tutoring Maths and Physics A-level and GCSE students, and 
learning guitar and about music in general. I then joined Pwc in a graduate Tax
technology role. Having found that was not for me, I began learning to code. In 
coding I found something I found really interesting and loved learning about. So I 
left Pwc and joined Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp.
